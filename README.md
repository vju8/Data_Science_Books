**Project Description:**  
Although living in a digital world where the majority of information can be found online, books are still considered an important sources of learning and skill improvement.
Moreover, the books provide a high reliability, since the content published is screened before publishing, the information being much more trustworphy compared to the

the best books on the topic and how do the price fluctuate compared to the other similar books. In addition to that, a good recommandation of people who bought and 
used the book already is always a good confirmation of the buying choice. All of these informations are present in the initial dataset taken from www.kaggle.com presenting
